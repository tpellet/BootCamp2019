    "Integrals of the form $\\int_a^b g(x)dx$ arise often in economic models. One example is the aggregating of consumption amounts of a continuum of differentiated goods $c_t(i)$,\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $C_t$ is aggregate consumption, $\\alpha_i$ is a weight on the particular amount of consumption of good $i$, $\\varepsilon$ is the constant elasticity of substitution between different goods $i$, and the measure of goods is normalized to be between 0 and 1, without loss of generality. This consumption aggregator is often called the Armington aggregator as it was first proposed in Armington (1969). It is also known as a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator after its use in Dixit and Stiglitz (1977). Another key example of an integral that often occurs in macroeconomics is the expectations operator on the right-hand-side of the standard intertermporal Euler equation,\n",

    "\n",
    "It is a rare convenience when these integrals can be evaluated analytically. However, it does not take much richness in functional form to render analytical solutions impossible for many integrals in economic models. In these cases, the integral must be computed numerically. The following discussion of numerical integration draws from the great treatments of the subject in Heer and Maussner (2009, pp. 598-603), Judd (1998, ch. 7), and Adda and Cooper (2003, pp. 55-60)."

    "In the Newton-Cotes quadrature methods of approximating an integral, nodes and weights for the approximation $\\sum_{n=1}^N\\omega_n g(x_n)$ are chosen without much attention to the effect of the placement of these nodes or the levels of the weights on the accuracy of the approximation. Newton-Cotes methods are computationally fast, but lack in accuracy. Gaussian quadrature methods spend more computational time choosing \"optimal\" weights and nodes, but this gives an accuracy payoff over Newton-Cotes formulas. Monte Carlo integration methods use the computationally fast method of drawing uniformly from the support of the variable of integration. These methods depend on a large number of draws to get high accuracy. Judd (1998, pp. 309-311) spends significant time explaining that these methods are more correctly called \"pseudo-Monte Carlo methods\" because they make use of pseudorandom number generators, the use of which cannot invoke the law of large numbers or the central limit theorem. However, the biases introduced by pseudorandom number generators are rarely significant in practice. Although Monte Carlo integration methods do not converge as quickly as Gaussian quadrature methods for functions of one variable, they are especially valuable when integrating over functions of multiple variables.\n",

Quasi-Monte Carlo methods use the same approximating function $\\sum_{n=1}^N\\omega_n g(x_n)$, but draw on number theory and Fourier analytic methods to create low-discrepancy sequences that are used as sample points.

    "A key distinction between quasirandom sequences and pseudorandom sequences is that quasirandom sequences do not \"look like\" random numbers. As can be seen in the figures above, they generally display quite obvious patterns. From the outset, quasirandom sequences are chosen so as to have low discrepancy, and are not encumbered by any other requirements of random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, equidistribution is a rather weak criterion to express the idea that a sequence is uniform. Even though the discrepancy approaches zero as $n$ approaches infinity, the Weyl sequence in the figure above shows how there will often be large gaps for small $n$. An alternative approach is to use low-discrepancy sequences. The goal of a low-discrepancy sequence is to minimize the star-discrepancy of every subsequence. In contrast to equidistributed sequences, the algorithms to generate these sequences take into account the total number of points desired so that maximum uniformity is achieved for every subsequence, and not just in the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Halton sequences describe a class of low-discrepancy multidimensional sequences that fill the interval $[0,1)$. To construct a Halton sequence, begin with a consecutive sequence of positive integers of length $N$, for example $n=1,2,\\ldots,N$. Now choose any prime number $p$ and convert each integer $n$ into its representation in the base $p$ number system.  For multiple dimensions, repeat the process with a different prime $p$. Then reflect the base $p$ representation of each integer about the decimal point to obtain a number in the interval $[0,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other techniques exist for creating low-discrepancy sequences. Faure' sequences are permutations of Halton sequences. Sobol sequences are a reordering of Halton sequences. Other methods include $(t,m,s)$-Nets and the method of good lattice points. Niederreiter (1978) is a good resource on low-discrepancy sequences in quasi-Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quasi-Monte Carlo methods do far better asymptotically than any Monte Carlo method for many problems. With $N$ points in $s$ dimensions, quasi-Monte Carlo techniques have a worst-case convergence rate of $O \\left( \\frac{\\left(  \\log N\\right) ^s}{N} \\right)$ as opposed to $O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\right)$ for standard Monte Carlo techniques.  However, standard Monte Carlo integration is easier to implement properly and is generally sufficient for most purposes."

    "## 5. Sparse Grids\n",
    "Sparse grid interpolation is a method of approximating functions with many dimensions. A direct way of representing multidimensional functions is to use a full grid, such as in Newton-Cotes quadrature. However, using this method the number of grid points that have to be computed depends exponentially on the number of dimensions. Because of this curse of dimensionality, processing functions of beyond five or six dimensions becomes intractable using the techniques of Sections 2 and 3. While Monte Carlo methods perform reasonably well in multidimensional integration, sparse grids remain the most efficient.\n",

    "The sparse grid method selects the nodes of integration by a special truncation of the tensor product expansion of a one-dimensional multilevel selection of nodes.

These points are used to create the corresponding product grids $\\Delta_{k_1}\\otimes\\Delta_{k_2}$ for $1\\leq k_1,k_2\\leq3$. Because the grid points used in the trapezoid rule are nested, many of the grid points are cancelled out, and the only ones that remain are formed from a union of the grids along the diagonal as indicated by the black line.
